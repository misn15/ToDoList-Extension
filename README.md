# To Do List Browser Extension

This browser extension uses Todoist API to keep track of a list of to do items.

## Getting Started

You will need to have [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed. Download a copy of this code to a folder on your computer.

Install all the required packages:

```
npm install
```

Build the extension from webpack

```
npm run build
```

To install on Edge, use the 'three dot' menu on the top right corner of the browser to find the Extensions panel. From there, select 'Load Unpacked' to load a new extension. Open the 'dist' folder at the prompt and the extension will load. To use it, you will need an API key for Todoist's API ([get one here](https://www.todoist.com/)).
